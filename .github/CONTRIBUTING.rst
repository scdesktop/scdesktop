SCDesktop: Contributor Guidelines
=================================

Before contributing, please read our `code style`_ and the `license <https://github.com/scdesktop/scdesktop/blob/develop/LICENSE>`_.
To change the source code, 
fork the ``develop`` branch of this repository and work inside your own branch. 
Then send us a PR into ``develop`` branch and wait for the CI to check everything. However, you'd better check changes first locally.

Do not forget to fill in CHANGELOG.md, 
the maintainers of the project will check the changes and, if the description is correct, they will add your changes to the project.

To report a bug, suggest new functionality, 
or ask a question, go to `Issues <https://github.com/scdesktop/scdesktop/issues>`_. 
Try to make MRE (Minimal Reproducible Example) and specify your scdesktop version to let others help you.
