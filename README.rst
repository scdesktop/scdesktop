`SoundCloud Desktop <https://soundcloud.com>`_ â€“ For Windows
============================================================

This program is created for further use of ordinary Internet users. 
The idea is to listen to music from the streaming platform directly without going to the site. 
The created program will provide an opportunity to listen to music from the SoundCloud website on your computer, - as an application.

The author chose the Windows operating system for this application, because he himself uses the system.
In the future, the author will think about implementing it on other platforms, but the possibility of this is very small.
